"""
One-time (rerunnable) seed script: imports data/processed/ifnd_full.parquet
(1002 rows -- the full IFND disaster subset already run through Stages
2-7 by src/build_baseline.py / classify_ifnd.py / locate_ifnd.py, the same
file dashboard/app.py's tab 2 already reads live) into the database, so
the React dashboard/map/claims list have realistic, non-trivial content
immediately on a fresh clone rather than starting completely empty.

Deliberately does NOT re-run the ML pipeline on these 1002 rows -- the
parquet already has primary_type/verdict/verdict_confidence/priority/
priority_score computed, and reprocessing all of them through
analyze_claim() would be slow and pointless (same result, much more work).
Two things it CANNOT reuse from the parquet, so they're intentionally
left unset for seeded rows rather than fabricated:
  - top_terms (per-instance TF-IDF explainability) -- would require
    literally re-running the classifier per row.
  - stored-corpus verification / live-feed evidence -- these are query-
    time concepts (SourceVerifier's own reference corpus, or "recent"
    external feed events), not something that was computed once and
    can be replayed for a years-old historical headline.

Every seeded row is is_historical_seed=True, source="ifnd_dataset" --
never rendered as a live/manual submission anywhere in the UI.
